* Very few Association Arrows being drawn.  Need to go back and figure out why
* Some arrows not showing the one-to-many relationship in Pizza uml
* Field, return, and Parameter types not showing the elements contained in a Collection
* Sequence Diagrams look good
* need to refactor code.  Classes are of a good length, but some methods very large. (Namely, Association and Dependency Analyzers)
* UML arrows correct in where they are pointing
